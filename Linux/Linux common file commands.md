## Creating Files

**touch command** - The most common way to create an empty file:

```bash
touch filename.txt
```

This creates an empty file called `filename.txt` in the current directory. You can also create multiple files at once:[^1][^5][^6]

```bash
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

**cat command** - Creates a file and allows you to add content immediately:

```bash
cat > newfile.txt
```

After running this command, you can type content and press `Ctrl+D` to save and exit.[^6][^1]

**Redirection operator** - Simple way to create an empty file:

```bash
> emptyfile.txt
```


## Renaming Files

**mv command** - Linux doesn't have a dedicated rename command, so the move (`mv`) command is used for renaming:

```bash
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
```

This changes the file from `oldname.txt` to `newname.txt`. The `mv` command essentially moves the file contents to a new filename, effectively renaming it.[^2][^3][^1]

## Deleting Files

**rm command** - Removes files permanently:

```bash
rm filename.txt
```

You can delete multiple files at once:

```bash
rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

For directories, you need the `-r` (recursive) flag:

```bash
rm -r directoryname
```
