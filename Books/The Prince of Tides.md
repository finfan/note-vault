I did not finish this book. Not because it was bad it just was not my style.
The following is a summery of the book

The provided excerpts, primarily from "The Prince of Tides" by Pat Conroy, **chronicle the complex and often traumatic history of the Wingo family, particularly through the eyes of Tom Wingo**. The narrative **explores his strained relationships with his emotionally abusive mother, his violent father, and his deeply troubled twin sister Savannah**, a poet struggling with mental illness. Themes of **Southern identity, family dysfunction, and the enduring impact of childhood experiences** are central, highlighted by flashbacks to pivotal moments such as a home invasion and a family tragedy involving the drowning of a stillborn sister. The text also **details Tom's personal journey, including his role as a football coach, his attempts to reconcile with his wife Sallie, and his relationship with Savannah's psychiatrist, Susan Lowenstein**, as he grapples with his past and tries to understand the roots of his family's suffering.
