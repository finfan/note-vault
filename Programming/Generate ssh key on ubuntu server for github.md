# could you give me the steps to install an ssh ket on ubuntu server for github?

Here are the complete steps to install and configure an SSH key on Ubuntu Server for GitHub:

## Generate SSH Key

First, create the SSH directory and generate your key pair :[^1]

```bash
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -o -t ed25519 -C "steve.lassila@warren-ind.com"
```

If your system doesn't support ed25519, use RSA instead :[^2]

```bash
ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -b 4096 -C "steve.lassila@warren-ind.com"
```

When prompted, press Enter to accept the default file location. You can optionally set a passphrase for additional security.[^1]

## Start SSH Agent and Add Key

Start the SSH agent and add your private key :[^2]

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

For RSA keys, use:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```


## Copy Public Key to Clipboard

Display and copy your public key :[^2]

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

For RSA keys:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the entire output including the email at the end.[^1]

## Add Key to GitHub Account

1. Log into GitHub and go to **Settings** (click your profile picture in the top-right corner)[^3]
2. In the sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**[^3]
3. Click **New SSH key** or **Add SSH key**[^3]
4. Add a descriptive title like "Ubuntu Server"[^3]
5. Select **Authentication** as the key type[^3]
6. Paste your public key in the **Key** field[^3]
7. Click **Add SSH key**[^3]

## Test SSH Connection

Verify your setup works by testing the connection :[^4][^2]

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a message like:

```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

The first time you connect, you'll be asked to verify GitHub's fingerprint - type "yes" to continue.[^4]

## Configure Git (Optional)

If you have existing repositories using HTTPS, switch them to SSH :[^2]

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

Your SSH key is now installed and configured for GitHub access on Ubuntu Server. You can now clone, push, and pull from GitHub repositories without entering your password each time.[^1][^2]
